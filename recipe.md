STEP 1:
Prepare and bake the red velvet cake mix according to the directions of the package or according to the by scratch recipe.

STEP 2:
Once baked, allow the cake to cool completely.

STEP 3:
Crumble the cake into a large bowl and work it with your hands until it is in small pieces.

STEP 4:
If desired, reserve a few spoonfuls of crumbs to use as decorative toppings on the finished truffles.

STEP 5:
Spoon three-fourths of the frosting into the bowl and stir with a rubber spatula until the mixture is well combined.

STEP 6:
It should be very moist and hold together if you squeeze a ball of cake between your fingers, but not too wet or greasy.

STEP 7:
If the cake mixture is still a bit dry, add more frosting to reach the desired consistency.

STEP 8:
Using a small cookie or candy scoop or a tablespoon, scoop out small balls of cake and roll between your palms until they are round.

STEP 9:
Place the cakes balls on a baking sheet covered with aluminum foil and refrigerate them while you prepare the candy coating.

STEP 10:
Place the candy coating in a medium microwave-safe bowl and microwave it until melted, stirring after every 45 seconds to prevent overheating.

STEP 11:
Using dipping tools or a fork, submerge a cake ball in the melted candy coating.

STEP 12:
Remove it from the coating and drag the bottom across the rim of the bowl to remove excess coating.

STEP 13:
Replace the dipped truffle on the foil-covered baking sheet.

STEP 14:
If desired, top it with a sprinkle of cake crumbs, small candies, or other decorations while the coating is still wet. Repeat with remaining cake balls.

STEP 15:
Refrigerate the truffles to set the coating completely, this will take about 20 minutes.
