So here's how we make Red Velvet Truffles. 
These are balls of delicious red velvet cake mixed with cream cheese frosting. The cake balls are then dipped in candy coating for a moist, sweet and tangy cake bite in candy form.. 
They are bite size and super delicious so OM NOM NOM and they'll be over in no time..!! :)
